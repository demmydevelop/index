<p><b><i>Paragraphs</i></b> are the <b>building blocks of papers</b>.
Many students define paragraphs in terms of <u>length:</u>
a paragraph is a group of at least <i>five sentences,</i>
a paragraph is <b>half a page long,</b> etc. In reality,
though, <i>the unity and coherence of ideas among
sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</i></p>
<p>Most paragraphs in an essay have a <b>three-part
structureâ€”introduction, body, and conclusion.</b>
You can see this structure in paragraphs whether
they are narrating, describing, comparing,
contrasting, or analyzing information.
Each part of the paragraph plays an important
role in <b><i>communicating your meaning to your reader</i><b>.</p>
<p>A paragraph is a group of sentences that <b>convey an idea.</b>
Each sentence works together as part of a <b>unit</b> to create
an overall thought or <i>impression.</i> A paragraph is the
<u>smallest unit or cluster of sentences</u> in which one 
<i>idea can be developed adequately.</i></p>
